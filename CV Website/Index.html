		<H3> Technical Skills </H3>
		<p>
			I also have a good understanding of the programming languages C, Java, Python, HTML 
			and CSS.
		</p>
		<p>
			Making simple ATM programs in C that require PINs to view any data that had been 
			entered.
		</p>
		<p>
			Programming Lego Mindstorm Robot for it to use sensers to alter how it acts. This 
			was a very interesting project as I got to see how my code ran in the real world 
			rather than just in simulations. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Using Python to create a program that will allow the user to generate a Pascals 
			Triangle with however many lines they choose. This was made as a lab test for my 
			Object Oriented Programming module in second year. The program had to allow the 
			user to input the amount of lines they wanted to see and then the triangle would 
			be displayed as lists and then as a centered triangle in the command prompt. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Representing a 3D Vector in a Python class and creating functions to initialize, 
			add, subtract, multiply and find the magnitude of the vectors. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Experience working with SQL Developer to create and maintain databases.
			Building a PC and partitioning the drive to install a dual boot with Windows and 
			Ubuntu.
		</p>
		<p>
			I am proficient in the use of Microsoft Office which was greatly enhanced by the 
			module Data Exploration which gave me a more in depth understanding of both Excel 
			and Access.
		</p>
		
		<H3> Communication Skills </H3>
		<p>
			My communication skills were greatly enhanced by my experience in 
			working with customers.
		</p>
		<p>
			My module in college Communications and Personal Development also greatly
			aided my communication skills through fundraising and presentations.
		</p>
		<p>
			I can also work well as a team thanks to the module mentioned above and 
			my below work experience.
